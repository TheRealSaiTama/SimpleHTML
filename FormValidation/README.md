## Overview

The **Form Validation** project is a simple yet effective demonstration of client-side form validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It ensures that users provide valid input before submitting a registration form. The project includes real-time error messages to guide users in correcting their input.

## Features

- **Username Validation**: Ensures the username field is not left blank.
- **Email Validation**: Checks if the email field is not empty and validates the email format.
- **Password Validation**: Verifies that the password is at least 8 characters long.
- **Confirm Password Validation**: Ensures the confirm password matches the original password.
- **Real-Time Error Messages**: Displays error messages next to each input field in real-time.
- **Stylish UI**: A clean and user-friendly interface with responsive design.

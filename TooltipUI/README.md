# Tooltip UI: A Sleek Hover - Based Information Display
![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-success?style=for-the-badge)

## üöÄ Introduction
The Tooltip UI project is a remarkable implementation of tooltips in a web - based environment. Inspired by [roadmap.sh/projects/tooltip-ui](https://roadmap.sh/projects/tooltip-ui), it brings to life the concept of providing additional information on - demand. Tooltips are those handy little boxes that pop up when you hover over an element, giving you extra details without cluttering the main interface. This project uses nothing but pure HTML and CSS to create an elegant and functional tooltip system.

## üåü Features
- **Responsive Design**: The tooltips adapt gracefully to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Enjoy a seamless fade - in and fade - out effect when hovering over tooltip elements, thanks to carefully crafted CSS transitions.
- **Custom Styling**: Tailor the look and feel of the tooltips to match your project's aesthetics. From colors to sizes, it's all up for grabs.

## üìπ Live Demo
Currently, there's no live - hosted version available. However, you can easily run the project locally by following the steps in the installation section.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheRealSaitama/SimpleHTML.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd SimpleHTML/TooltipUI
   ```
3. **Open the Project**:
   Open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.

## üìã Usage
The HTML structure in `index.html` has elements set up to trigger tooltips. Each `span` with the `tooltip` class has a nested `span` with the `tooltiptext` class that contains the actual tooltip content.
```html
<span class="tooltip">Home <span class="tooltiptext">Here's My Home Page</span></span>
```
When you hover over the `tooltip` element, the `tooltiptext` will appear, providing the additional information.

## üß± Code Structure
### `index.html`
- Sets up the basic HTML5 structure with a proper `DOCTYPE`, `html` tag, and the necessary `head` and `body` sections.
- In the `head` section, it defines the character encoding, viewport settings, page title, and links to the CSS file.
- The `body` contains a `header` with the class `tip`. Inside the `header`, there are multiple `span` elements with the `tooltip` class, each having a nested `span` with the `tooltiptext` class.

### `style.css`
- **Global Resets**: Resets the margin and padding for all elements (`*` selector) to ensure a clean starting point.
- **Body Styling**: Sets the font family to sans - serif, a light gray background color, and uses flexbox to center the content vertically and horizontally on the viewport.
- **Header Styling**: The `tip` class uses flexbox to center its child elements and sets a large font size. It also adds small gray dots between non - last `span` elements.
- **Tooltip Styling**:
    - The `tooltip` class positions the element relatively and sets a cursor style to indicate interactivity.
    - The `tooltiptext` class defines the appearance of the tooltip. It starts invisible and with zero opacity. When the `tooltip` element is hovered over, the `tooltiptext` becomes visible with a smooth opacity transition. The arrow at the bottom of the tooltip is also styled here.

## üé® Customization
### Changing Colors
Modify the `background - color` and `color` properties in the `.tooltiptext` class in `style.css` to change the tooltip's background and text colors.
```css
.tooltiptext {
    background - color: #3498db; /* Change to your desired color */
    color: white;
}
```

### Adjusting Sizes
Change the `width` property in the `.tooltiptext` class to adjust the width of the tooltip. You can also modify the font size by adding a `font - size` property.
```css
.tooltiptext {
    width: 400px; /* Adjust the width */
    font - size: 18px; /* Adjust the font size */
}
```

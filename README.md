## Overview

This repository is divided into two main directories, each containing a project:

1. **OnePageCV**: A simple, single-page CV template showcasing my professional background.
2. **BasicHTMLWebSite**: A basic website with multiple pages (Home, Articles, Contact) to demonstrate fundamental HTML structure and navigation.

Both projects are built using pure HTML and are intended to serve as learning tools for beginners like myself.

## Learning Fullstack Development

I'm currently on a path to becoming a well-rounded fullstack developer. These projects are some of the initial steps in that journey. In the future, I intend to build upon this foundation by incorporating back-end functionalities and more advanced features using frameworks and libraries such as React, Node.js, and Express.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to expand my skill set!

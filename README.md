## Overview

This repository is divided into five main directories, each containing a project:

1.  **OnePageCV**: A simple, single-page CV template showcasing my professional background.
2.  **BasicHTMLWebSite**: A basic website with multiple pages (Home, Articles, Contact) to demonstrate fundamental HTML structure and navigation.
3.  **PersonalPortfolio**: A personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, experience, and education.
4.  **Changelog**: A page documenting recent updates and changes made to the projects.
5.  **Keylogger**: A simple keylogger application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating event handling for keypresses.

All projects are built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for the Keylogger) and are intended to serve as learning tools for beginners like myself.

## Learning Fullstack Development

I'm currently on a path to becoming a well-rounded fullstack developer. These projects are some of the initial steps in that journey. In the future, I intend to build upon this foundation by incorporating back-end functionalities and more advanced features using frameworks and libraries such as React, Node.js, and Express.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to expand my skill set!

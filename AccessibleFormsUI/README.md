# Accessible Forms UI

This project demonstrates an accessible form UI built with HTML and Tailwind CSS. It focuses on implementing best practices for form accessibility, including proper labeling, ARIA attributes, and visual cues.

## Overview

This project consists of the following files:

*   **`index.html`**: The main HTML file that structures the accessible form UI.
*   **`src/output.css`**: The CSS file generated by Tailwind CSS, which styles the form.
*   **`src/input.css`**: The source CSS file for Tailwind CSS.
*   **`package.json` and `package-lock.json`**: npm package manifest files that hold metadata of the project.
*   **`.gitignore`**: specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## Features

*   **Semantic HTML:** Uses semantic HTML elements for better structure and accessibility.
*   **Proper Labeling:** Implements clear and descriptive labels for all form fields.
*   **ARIA Attributes:** Utilizes ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility for screen readers.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** Leverages Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design.
*   **Password Visibility Toggle:** Includes a JavaScript function to toggle password visibility.
*   **Visual Feedback:** Provides visual feedback for form validation and errors.

## Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   Tailwind CSS
*   JavaScript
*   ARIA Attributes
